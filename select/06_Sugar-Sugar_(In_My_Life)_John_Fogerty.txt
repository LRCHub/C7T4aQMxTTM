Everybody want it, Everybody need it
Everybody got to have it, Everybody knows

(Chorus)
Lookin' for some, sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!

When the day is over, and the work is done
That's when I got to find my baby, Shes the only one

(Chorus)

(Lead)

Mama always told me, Don't yah be no fool
Take some time to share your lovin', That's the golden rule

Got to have some, sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life! X3
