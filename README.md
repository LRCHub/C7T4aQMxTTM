Sugar
Oh, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

Honey
Oh, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

I just can't believe
The loveliness of loving you
I just can't believe it's true
I just can't believe
The wonder of this feeling, too
I just can't believe it's true

Ah, sugar
Oh, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

Oh, honey
Oh, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you got me f- wanting you

When I kissed you, girl
I knew how sweet a kiss could be
(I know how sweet a kiss can be)
Like the summer sunshine
Pour your sweetness over me
(Pour your sweetness over me)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, sugar
Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
Make your life so sweet, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pour a little sugar on it, oh yeah
Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
I'm gonna make your life so sweet, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Ah, sugar
Ah-ah-ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Honey (honey, sugar, sugar)
Sugar sugar (honey, honey, sugar, sugar)
You are my candy girl
